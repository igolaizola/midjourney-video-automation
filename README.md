## üé• What does Midjourney Video Automation do?

Midjourney Video Automation empowers you to automate video generation on [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com) using both text prompts and existing images‚Äîno manual intervention required. With this actor, you can:

- ü§ñ **Bulk process** multiple prompts or image inputs to create videos
- üéûÔ∏è **Text-to-Video**: generate a sequence of images from prompts and stitch them into a short video
- üì∏ **Image-to-Video**: convert your own images (via URLs or a Google Drive folder) into videos, optionally enhanced with prompts
- ‚ö° **Extensions**: add extra seconds to each video (4 s per extension)
- üîÑ **Concurrency**: run multiple jobs in parallel
- ‚è≥ **Randomized wait times** between operations to mimic human usage
- üìÅ **Album HTML**: auto-generate an `album.html` in Key-Value storage for easy browsing and downloading

## üîë Prerequisites

1. An active Midjourney subscription (Standard Plan or higher to use **Relaxed** mode)
2. Your Midjourney cookie for authentication
3. The [Cookie-Editor Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm)

## üöÄ Setup Guide

### 1. Getting Your Midjourney Cookie

1. Install the **Cookie-Editor** Chrome extension.
2. Log in to [www.midjourney.com](https://www.midjourney.com).
3. Click the Cookie-Editor icon and grant permissions if prompted.
4. Choose **Export** ‚Üí **Export as Header String**.
5. Copy the resulting cookie string.

### 2. Running the Actor

1. In the actor's input form, paste your cookie into the `cookie` field.
2. Provide either:

   - A list of **text prompts** (`prompts`) for text-to-video, or
   - A list of **image URLs** (`images`) and/or a **Google Drive folder URL** (`googleDriveFolder`) for image-to-video.

3. Choose your **mode** (`relaxed`, `fast`, or `turbo`).
4. (Optional) Set the number of **extensions** to lengthen each video by 4 s each.
5. Configure **concurrency**, **minWait**, **maxWait**, and **jobTimeout** as needed.
6. Select your **proxy configuration** (Apify Proxy recommended).
7. Click **Run**.

## üéûÔ∏è Accessing Generated Videos

The actor saves an "album.html" file to the KeyValue store for easy browsing and downloading of generated videos. You can access it by:

- Clicking any "Album URL" field in the results table
- Going to Run > Storage > KeyValueStore and finding the "album.html" file

The album interface provides several features:

- Filter videos by prompt text or other metadata
- Select multiple videos for batch operations
- Open videos in new tabs for detailed viewing
- Download selected videos as a ZIP file

Here's an example album showcasing some generated videos so you can see how your results will be displayed: [Browse Example Gallery](https://igolaizola.github.io/midjourney-video-automation/)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Usage Guidelines & Best Practices

### Account Safety

- Midjourney may flag excessive automation; use responsibly.
- Only automate tasks you would normally perform manually.
- Avoid continuous 24/7 runs.

### Performance Optimization

- Start with low concurrency (1‚Äì2) and increase based on success rates.
- Use proxies from your region for more reliable access.
- Tune `minWait`/`maxWait` to balance speed and rate-limit safety.
- Update your cookie periodically for long sessions.

### General Tips

- Test with a small batch of prompts or images first.
- Use clear, descriptive prompts for better video content.
- Monitor and review failed jobs; they won't halt your run.
